# Dummy Javascript Emulator

After see the amazing things that the people is doing with Javascript, like the [Linux Javascript Emulator](http://stud.hro.nl/0814604/jslinuxdemo/emulator.html) I just couldn't resist to make my own _Windows_ and _OSX_ Javascript emulators.

Atention: this is just a joke.
